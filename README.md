Running this bot requires:

a) Your own reddit account and credentials

b) An API key from reddit

c) praw, pandas

d) Python 3.6

## Some questions and answers

### Q: Why not SQL?

A: Honestly, SQL just isn't the best idea for Python. Multiline strings for queries just isn't fun. Numpy and Pandas are also extremely well integrated with each other, which is a big help when looking at data trends. See matplotlib.

And the main thing? Pandas is a data analysis toolkit. And when it comes to coding, Python is the language for data analysis.

Pandas also includes SQL support and to_sql methods, which should be the final killer.

### Q: Why do you have a seperate class for Pandas dataframes?

A: I'm lazy. Pandas has all sorts of obscenely long individual lines. Let's say I want to add a row to a Pandas dataframe:

df = df.append(pd.DataFrame({data: [goes, here]}, columns=[list, of, columns, here]), ignore_index=True)

So I cut this down by 90 characters or so (yes, that is a reasonable estimate of how long each line would be). It's probably bad practice, so let me know if you have a better idea.

### Can I run this myself?

A: Yes, so long as you have an API key and user account on Reddit set up for development.
